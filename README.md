This project was developed to demonstrate how you would be able to create a react table component with the styled-components library. The whole development process was recorded in a videocast; You could watch it on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLpQyF6JOCE).

type Props = {
  columns: {
    [key: string]: {
      key: string,
      label?: string,
      align?: "center" | "left" | "right",
      width?: number,
      content?: Function,
      css?: string,
      cssHeader?: string,
      hideOnDesktop?: boolean,
      hideOnTablet?: boolean,
      hideOnPhone?: boolean
    }
  },
  data?: Array<Object>,
  rowConfig?: {
    uniqueKey?: string,
    css?: string,
    onClick?: Function
  },
  currentPage: number,
  totalPages: number,
  basePageLink: string
};
```
